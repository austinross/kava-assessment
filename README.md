# kava-assessment

To run the project, clone the repo and run this in the directory:
```bash
go run .
```

The tests show that there is coverage for 88.7% of statements, and this is because there are no tests for ```main.go```

This was an interesting project since I've only used Go in a project once before, so I am looking forward to any feedback!
